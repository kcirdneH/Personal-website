            <h1>His Demographics</h1>
           <p>Name: Jake Hendrick B. Collado</p>
           <p>Age: 17 (Turning 18 this year ^^)</p>
           <p>Date of birth: 06/14/2006</p>
           <p>Sex: Male</p>
           <p>Place of Birth: Perpertual</p>
           <p>School: Las Pinas City National Senior High School - Dona Josefa Campus</p> 
           <p>School year: 2023-2024</p>
           <p>Strand and Section: TVL-ICT 12-Tenacious</p>
           <br>

            <h1>What makes Jake a person?</h1>
           <p> Starting with hobbies, Jake's hobbies are playing musical instruments such as guitars, bass, and drums, 
            as well as listening to music 24/7. Despite that, he also draws very well, but still canot do realism portraits,
            yet his sketches are clean and very amusing. On his spare time, it's either he codes some programs or just
            reads books and mangas. Lastly, he loves games, especially FPS (First-Peson Shooter games such as Cal of Duty) and 
            RPG games (Role Playing Games such as Terraria).</p> 
            <br>
           <p>Even though he all has those talents and gifts, he will always make room to study no matter what, and as a result
            he always gets good grades and gets promotions and acknowledgement by some teachers such as being in the top 6 during
            his first year in SHS, participating in school  events, especially poster making and concerts, and achieved in the
            top 5 on which he ranked 4th in his second year in SHS. He is also 
            a God fearing man and comes to Church Daily at Muntinlupa where he participates in the Music Ministry with His
            bas guitar. 
           </p> 
           <br>
           <p>School is almsot over since he is a graduating student in his last year in senior high, so what does he do in his 
            vacation? He mostly travels to different places, most of the time locally here in the Philippines especially in the
            parts of Batangas. But when he was young, he and his family mostly travles outside the Philippines to other countries
            such as Singapore. In his part of travelling, his favorite part is not to where they are travelling, it's when during
            the travel. Why? It's because he gets to listen and lock in to his music playlists on spotify (btw follow me on my 
            socials on the 'others' tab). The reason why is because he gets to relapse a bit. 
           </p>
